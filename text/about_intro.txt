'''For over three decades, climbers have made their way into the lush forests of northern Skåne, in search of something only they understand.'''
'''Have they received any answers?'''
'''The rocks sure don't say much, but they seem to be giving something, for year after year the climbers return. At this point there are quite a few boulders to play around on, test your grit against or dedicate your life to. Either way make sure to both enjoy and respect the forest — you are not the first and you won't be the last — so leave it a little better than you found it.'''
