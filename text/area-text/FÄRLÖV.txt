Färlöv is a small town surrounded by three separate sectors hosting lone blocs, and more quality climbing than you might expect. It’s not a major destination, but if you enjoy technical vertical climbing on good rock, it’s well worth a visit.

Norra Strö is the main attraction: a large roadside bloc with mostly solid landings. A few of the seventh-grade problems here are real gems — crimpy, technical, and satisfying. Some easier lines are available too, but the harder ones steal the show.

Färlövsblocket is a big, rounded boulder with great stone, perfect for beginners and kids. The landings are flat, the climbs are short and fun, and there’s no approach at all — though it sits in a suburban setting, the quality and ease make it a great stop. However, be mindful and respectful of the surroundings.

Spårblocket is a smaller bloc with a slightly longer approach, offering a surprising number of varied problems on rougher rock. A quiet little spot ideal for a change of pace.
