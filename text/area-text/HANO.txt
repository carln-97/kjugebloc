Hanö is a small, picturesque island off the northeast coast of Skåne — home to an abundance of boulders! This magical spot is the perfect summer refuge when the mainland forests become sweltering, mosquito-filled, and the rock turns greasy and unclimbable. The scenery is stunning and the view of the ocean as well as a cooling breeze always present – enabling summer sends! Most boulders are of moderate height (2–3 m), with soft grassy landings that make the area well-suited even for children. The rock quality is good—sometimes water-polished—and many granite outcropings are steep, offering physical climbing on large holds.

Beyond the climbing, Hanö offers varied hiking terrain and plenty of secluded swimming spots along the vast shoreline. A large deer population roams the island and is often seen darting through the trees—so if you bring a dog, be sure to keep it on a leash!
