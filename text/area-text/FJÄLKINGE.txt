Fjälkinge is the small village you pass on the way to Kjugekull — but it's also home to some worthwhile blocs. Whether as warm-up on the way in or cool-down on the way out, it's a fun detour off the beaten path with fresh rock to explore.

Lillis backe sits just outside the village, offering a few nice boulders and a taller wall with interesting lines. Most problems are in the lower range with flat landings and a short 5 min approach through open pastures. The climbing is technical and crimpy, on slightly rougher rock, much like Kjugekull.

On the other side of the hill lies Bockastenarna — an old rediscovered spot with several good lines – some of which would be classics even in Kjuge! The style varies from crimps to compression, with obvious, moderately tall problems ranging from easy to intermediate.
