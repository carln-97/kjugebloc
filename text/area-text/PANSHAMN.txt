Panshamn is a newer bouldering area nestled in open forest terrain along a calm lakeshore. The setting is scenic, with excellent rock quality and a variety of formations that make for fun and provoking climbs â€” mainly in the easy to moderate grade range. While the area is quite extensive, the high density of boulders means you're rarely far from the next problem.

A painted circuit connects 76 easy yet satisfying climbs, making for a great (and exhausting) way to explore the forest. After rain, the lakeside boulders tend to dry quickly, while those deeper in the eastern parts can seep for a while. All in all it's an accessible area worth visiting for anyone looking to refine their technique across a range of styles.
