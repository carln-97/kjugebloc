Leingaryd is a small, less-traveled area spread out along some power lines. Most of the climbs are relatively low with good landings and the solid rock quality typical of the eastern side of Ivösjön. However, a few taller formations can be found — most notably a larger wall deeper in the woods, featuring a peculiar and unique type of rock. Here, a handful of excellent vertical lines offer cool holds and some air beneath your feet. Underneath the power lines, the boulders provide more variety, with some steeper problems, difficult slabs, and subtle wrestling on slopers.
