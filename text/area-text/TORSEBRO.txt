Torsebro is the second most classical bouldering spot in Sk√•ne after Kjugekull. The blocs are scarcely dispersed along a small gravel road in an open beech forest with mixed in patches of firs. Most of the rocks are fairly large and a few are huge, however pretty much all of them have good landings. Regarding the rock quality, it's about the same as Kjugekull though a handful of blocs have more fine grained rock with less crystals. There are also a good few steep climbs with powerful moves, which you rarely find in these parts. With an easy approach, lots of climbs in most styles and all grades; Torsebro is a great area for beginners as well as experienced climbers!
