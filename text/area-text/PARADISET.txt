Paradiset is a remote and peaceful area with a few quality boulders scattered throughout the vast forest. The main attraction is the massive Cold Steel bloc, featuring some of the county’s best climbs. These are fairly tall lines on truly excellent rock, mostly in the moderate range. Landings are generally good, though the height of the bloc makes multiple pads and spotters a smart choice. The main bloc is easily accessed via a large path, while the other boulders require some off-trail bushwhacking.

Långa väggen is the other highlight of the area — a massive 60-meter-long wall tucked deep into the forest, requiring a decent hike to reach. It features tall, striking lines on bullet rock with cool holds and an impressive pumpfest of a traverse. The wall dries slowly, so it’s best visited in late spring or summer.
