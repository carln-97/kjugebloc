Oppmannaberget is perfect for escaping the crowds and enjoying calm climbing in Skåne’s dense beech forests. Most sectors require a bit of walking, though it's well worth it for proud stoic blocs with mostly good landings. Some taller lines may call for extra pads.

Climbing styles vary by sector, thanks to diverse rock types: rough reddish Vånga-granite friction-dependant stone similar to Kjugekull, and the unusually solid rock of the Bullseye-bloc, otherwise more common on the east side of Ivösjön. As a result you find both powerful climbing on big holds as well as techy maneuvering on tall faces. Oppmannaberget has a bit of everything for those willing to explore, including a number of projects waiting to be climbed.
