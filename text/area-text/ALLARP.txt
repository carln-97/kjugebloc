Allarp is a large, spread-out area made up of several smaller dense sectors, offering a wide range of climbs. The rock is excellent, and the boulders vary from lowballs to tall inspiring lines. Across the sectors you’ll find all kinds of styles—from technical slabs and vertical masterpieces to steep overhangs, sloping bulges, and intense compression problems.

Some sectors sit just next to the turquoise water of Levrasjön — ideal for relaxed climbing and a quiet swim, others are engulfed in green forest on all sides. Approaches vary widely, with everything from roadside blocs to hidden gems deep in the forest.
