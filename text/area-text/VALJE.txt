On the outskirts of the small village of Valje lies a cluster of compact boulders tucked into the lush surrounding forest. Despite being close to residential houses, the area feels surprisingly secludedâ€”especially in summer, when thick vegetation nearly seals it off from the outside world.

The grey-green boulders are tightly packed in a small but dense zone, notable for its abundance of steep problems. The smooth, compact rock is free of sharp crystals, making for friendlier skin and longer sessions. Most problems are low to mid-height with good landings, though a few taller lines add variety to the mix.
