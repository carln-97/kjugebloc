Balsberget is a sprawling forest area nestled just west of Kjugekull, stretching along the shores of the lake 'Råbelövssjön'. The landscape shifts between towering firs and ancient beech trees, creating a calm, atmospheric setting for climbing.

Most boulders are small to medium in size, scattered across the forest, with a few larger blocs located further in. The rock has a beautiful reddish character — solid, textured, and great to climb on. While the number of established routes is still limited, the potential is obvious, and a handful of harder test pieces are already in place. The approach is a bit on the longer side, but the trails are gentle and scenic, winding through calm, open woodland.
