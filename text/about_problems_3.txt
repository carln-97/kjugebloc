((Styles))
The main aspects which characterize a climb such as it's steepness, hold-type, and general form.
• arete – an outwards-facing corner
• bulge – a round bulge-formation
• crack – a crack-formation, possibly requiring jamming techniques
• dihedral – an inwards-facing corner
• dyno – a dynamic jump
• mantle – a tricky movement over a lip, often att the top of a climb
• overhang – the general angle is around 45°
• pillar – a protruding vertical formation
• prow – a protruding overhanging formation
• roof – the general angle is steeper than 45°
• slab – the general angle is less than vertical 
• slightly overhanging – the general angle is more than vertical 
• traverse – a climb which goes more sideways than up
• wall – the general angle is more or less vertical 

• crimps – small edges
• compression – squeezing climbing style
• pockets – pockets for one, two or more fingers
• pinches – protruding grips, pinched with thumb
• slopers – rounded holds
• underclings – inverted holds, grabbed from below

• morpho – easier if you're tall and considerably harder/impossible if you're short
• lowball – a low boulderproblem with a nice flat landing
• seeping – climbs which take a long time to dry, and so are often wet or damp
