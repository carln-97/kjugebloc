{Ethics}
» All problems are climbed the easiest way to the top, without violating their descriptions.
» All climbs start standing/sitting — no jump-, swing- or crouching starts unless stated otherwise.
» Start a climb from the ground or from one crashpad.
» No dabbing the surroundings.
» A climb ends at the very top of a bloc unless stated otherwise.
» It is considered bad style to rope down a climb before attempting it — ground-up is the way to go — unless it needs to be cleaned of moss.
» When flashing a climb you're only allowed to touch the holds you can reach from the ground, and if you've already climbed a variant with the same holds a flash is no longer possible.
» If using a burner to dry the stone, apply caution and avoid flakes/cracks since the heat might break the rock.
» When establishing a first ascent pay hommage by sticking to the naming-theme of the boulder/sector.
» No chipping, meaning artificially creating holds.
