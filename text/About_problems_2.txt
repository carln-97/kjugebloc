((Ratings))
Quality ratings are clearly subjective and should not be confused with how good an experience you might have on any given climb. Still, there are some classics which stand out based on rock-quality, aestethics, movement and location:
★ : One of the best in Skåne — worth visiting an area for this in itself.
☆ : One of the best for the grade in the area — seek it out!
((Exposure !))
Exposed climbs may be very tall, have poor landings or precarious movement with potential for bad falls. Either way the risk of injury is more pronounced, and lots of pads/spotters may be required. Take care!
((First ascentionists))
When known, the name of the first ascentionist as well as the year of the ascent is given. Historically some climbs got "team FAs", but this is no longer considered proper custom – as the term suggests, there can be only one first ascentionist... If a line has been re-climbed after a significant hold-break, the name of the old FA is displayed in (parentheses), before the new FA.
